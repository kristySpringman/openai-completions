#  OpenAI Completions Project
OpenAI is the creator of multiple AI models, each specializing in specific purposes. This project allows users to select which OpenAI Engine they wish to use and type in a prompt for the AI to answer. The data of the prompt is sent to OpenAI's API to retrieve and display the result back to the user. 

Some examples of prompts a user can send to OpenAI include:
* "Write me a poem about cats wearing pajamas in the snow" 
* "Create an outline for an essay about Nikola Tesla and his contributions to technology"
